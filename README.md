My Personal Portfolio Website
===============================

Welcome to my personal website. This site is a digital representation of who I am — my values, my work, and my ongoing journey as a professional and entrepreneur.

-------------------------------
About Me
-------------------------------
My name is Manuel. I am an experienced entrepreneur with over 40 years in business, now focused on launching new ventures in Portugal, particularly in the food and hospitality industries. My goal is to use my expertise to develop and scale a successful business system, ideally into a franchise model with 10 locations in 3–5 years. 

Beyond business, I’m passionate about cycling, community, and my faith. Jesus Christ has had a profound influence on my life and work, guiding every major decision I’ve made. This site reflects both my professional goals and personal convictions.
